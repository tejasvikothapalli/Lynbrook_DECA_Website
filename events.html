          <h2><span class="fa fa-edit"></span> Event Selection</h2>
          <p>In DECA, there are two main types of events: roleplays and written events. Roleplays are similar to interviews or business consultations, where members are the interviewee or the business professional, and the judge is either interviewing members or seeking their help. On the other hand, written events are pre-prepared written components and presentations in which members must create an advertising plan, come up with a new business idea, or think of ways to improve existing businesses (there are more variations to this depending on the event selected).
          </p>
          <p>One of the most important moments in DECA is choosing the right events. Members are allowed to compete at conferences with <strong>ONE</strong> written event and <strong>ONE</strong> roleplay event. We highly recommend members to participate in one of each type to maximize their chances of placing at a conference. Additionally, members may take part in as many online events and video challenges as they would like to potentially win any extra awards.

        <section id="roleplay">
          <h2><span class="fa fa-edit"></span> Roleplay Events</h2>
          <p>In roleplays, a situation will be presented to members when they arrive at their event, and they will have a short amount of time to prepare their response based on a given prompt and a set of indicators. The type of prompt and the content involved will defer based on its type of roleplay as well as the specific event. After this, members must go and present what they have come up with to the judge for approximately 10 minutes and answer any questions the judge may pose. When competing in roleplays, members must also take a test that will count for approximately 40% of the overall score.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:600">There are three types of roleplay events:<span>
            <ul class="shifted-bullet">
              <li>Principles Events</li>

            <h3>Principles Events</h3>
            <p>DECA's Principles Events measure members' proficiency in basic business concepts within all aspects of business, such as marketing, finance, business administration, emotional intelligence, etc. All members are tested through an interview situation with 10 minutes of preparation time, where members are interviewing for a position at the judge's company. Furthermore, these events are only open for first-year DECA members, so <strong>we highly recommend that all first-year members participate in a Principles Event for their roleplay</strong>, as they will then be competing against others with a similar level of experience.

            <h3>Team Decision Making Events</h3>
            <p>DECA's TDM Events test members on both conceptual knowledge as well as team dynamics. All teams are tested through some form of corporate interaction, where teams are given a prompt with 30 minutes of preparation time and asked for their opinion as per what to do based on the given situation. The judge is their client who evaluates them based on content presented, style and clarity of presentation, as well as team dynamics between the partners. Members must also take an exam (depends on the event selected), and the average of both partners' scores will be taken as a team exam score.

            <h3>Individual Series Events</h3>
            <p>DECA's Individual Series Events test members on both conceptual knowledge as well as thinking quickly under a time constraint. Members are given a prompt with 10 minutes of preparation time and asked for their opinion as per what to do based on the given situation. The judge is their client/boss who evaluates them based on content presented and style/clarity of presentation. Members must also take an exam (depends on the event selected), the score of which count towards 40% of the overall event score.

          <h2><span class="fa fa-edit"></span> Written Events</h2>
          <p>Written events are not as on-the-spot when compared to roleplays, because members must complete all aspects of the event before coming to the conference, including their written component, presentation, etc. Every written event is a bit different, but in general, each event has a written component as well as a presentation that must be made to the judge. The size of the written portion, the length of the presentation, and the task for the event is all dependent on what event members select.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:600">There are five types of written events:<span>
            <ul class="shifted-bullet">
              <li>Business Operations Research Events</li>
              <li>Chapter Team Events</li>
              <li>Entrepreneurship Events</li>
              <li>Marketing Representative Events</li>
              <li>Professional Selling Events</li>

            <h3>Business Operations Research Events</h3>
            <p>DECA’s BOR Events provide opportunities for members to demonstrate knowledge and skills needed by management personnel. Every year, DECA introduces a new topic that tests each participant's ability to develop a detailed business plan that solves or helps solve the problem presented. Members chooose a company of their liking, and based on the given topic, they must research the company and present what they have found, as well as the changes they think should be implemented. <strong>In this year's prompt, members are required to analyze current employee engagement and then present a plan to improve employee engagement within their chosen business or organization.</strong> Each type of BOR event has the same prompt, and they only differ in what company you are able to select to write your plan on. And so, <strong>we highly recommend that members choose a company, see what event it fits under, and then select that event</strong>, rather than selecting an event and then picking the company. No exam needs to be taken for a BOR event.

            <h3>Chapter Team Events</h3>
            <p>CTEs provide opportunities for members to become more involved within the chapter by attempting to run a successful campaign and engage everyone within the Lynbrook DECA chapter to help out and support the campaign. Because of the level of involvement required by these events, <strong>we highly recommend that only experienced members consider selecting one of these events for their written event choice</strong>. No exam is required for participating in a CTE. Furthermore, each chapter is only allowed to send one team to compete for each of the CTEs, so if anyone would like to compete in one of them, please inform a Lynbrook DECA officer ASAP so we can discuss your project.

            <p>DECA’s PSEs provide opportunities for members to market a product/company to a prospective buyer or provide a client with advice. A PSE is oriented around a person's speaking skills and provided ideas, and so does not have a written component (Yes, it's a written event without a written portion). Therefore, a PSE only requires members to create a presentation that answers the prompt provided by DECA. The prompt is different for each event.

          <h2><span class="fa fa-edit"></span> Online Events</h2>
          <p>DECA’s Online Events provide opportunities for members to participate in online simulations to learn how to invest in the stock market, manage personal finances, or operate a business venture. Online events don't count as written events or roleplays, so members may participate in them outside of their regular events, and these online events serve as a way to place for ICDC without placing at conferences. Members may participate in as many online events as they'd like, but no more than one account for each.
          </p>
          <p><span style="font-weight:600">There are two types of online events:<span>

            <h3>Stock Market Game</h3>
            <p>Participants in the Stock Market Game develop and manage an investment portfolio. Each participating team manages all aspects of the portfolio including stock selection, buying and selling. The goal of the competition is to increase the value of the beginning portfolio. Members may compete in Teams of 1-3, and there is nothing else besides the trading in the online portfolio that has to be done (no written component, test, etc.). For Lynbrook, the top 25 teams in Western USA will advance to compete at ICDC. Winners will be judged on the growth of their portfolio from the initial amount of virtual money.

            <h3>Virtual Business Challenges</h3>
            <p>Participants in the DECA Virtual Business Challenge (VBC) operate a computerized business simulation utilizing a competition version of the Virtual Business software. The VBC qualifying rounds are conducted via the Internet, where participants post competition scores for chartered association, regional and overall rankings. Think of VBC as a SIMS game, but oriented towards business and with profit as the main goal. Members can compete in VBCs as Teams of 1-3. The top two teams from each region (for Lynbrook, that's Western USA) will be able to compete at ICDC.

          <p>DECA and several corporate partners collaborate to offer DECA members opportunities to demonstrate the knowledge and skills learned in the classroom through innovative challenges. Each challenge has a unique focus and a specific set of required tasks, but one common element is the requirement that presentations are made via YouTube videos. These video challenges are not considered competitive events, but taking part gives members a chance to win cash prizes, awards, recognition, and more! There are three video challenges, as listed below.
